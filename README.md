I have created a To-Do App using JavaScript and hosted it on GitHub Pages. Let's take a closer look at your code and project.

**Overview:**
My To-Do App is a web application that allows users to create, manage, and track their tasks or to-do items. It appears to be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Features:**

- **Task Creation:** Users can create tasks by entering a task name and clicking the "Add" button.
- **Task Deletion:** Users can delete tasks by clicking the "Delete" button next to each task.
- **Task Completion:** Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking the checkbox next to each task.
- **Task Filtering:** Users can filter tasks based on their completion status (i.e., all tasks, completed tasks, or active tasks).
- **Task Persistence:** Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, allowing users to close the app and return later to see their tasks still present.

**Code structure:**

- **HTML:** The HTML file appears to contain the structure of the web page, including the main container, input field, buttons, and task list.
- **CSS:** The CSS file contains the styling for the web page, including the layout, colors, and fonts.
- **JavaScript:** The JavaScript file contains the logic for handling user interactions and managing the tasks. It includes event listeners for capturing user actions, functions for adding, deleting, and filtering tasks, as well as functions for storing and retrieving tasks from local storage.

Overall, it seems like I have created a simple but functional To-Do App using JavaScript. Users can add, delete, and complete tasks, and tasks are persisted in the browser's local storage. Keep in mind that this is a basic implementation, and you can further enhance it by adding features such as task prioritization, due dates, and user authentication, among others, depending on your requirements.
